# Repository for Emerging Technologies Module - 4th Year Software Development
Student ID: G00406694
Name: Shane Walsh

This repository contains projects and tasks completed as part of the Emerging Technologies module at Atlantic Technological University (ATU). The repository is divided into two main sections: a tasks folder with various assignments exploring trigrams and an ELIZA chatbot project.

### Trigrams

The [`tasks`](tasks) folder contains a Jupyter notebook (`trigrams.ipynb`) that explores the concepts of trigrams. A trigram is a sequence of three characters extracted from a given text. The notebook includes tasks such as:

- Cleaning text data by removing unwanted characters and converting it to uppercase.
- Building a trigram model by counting occurrences of three-character sequences.
- Merging multiple trigram models into one for a collective count.
- Processing text files to extract and analyze trigrams.

### ELIZA Chatbot Project

The [`eliza`](eliza) folder contains an implementation of the ELIZA chatbot using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The chatbot simulates a conversation with a psychotherapist by reflecting user inputs and generating responses. It implements reflections of user wording in responses and REGEX. This is complete with a general visual look akin to chatbots seen today.

## How to Run This Repository

### Prerequisites

- Visual Studio Code or GitHub Codespaces
- Node.js and npm (for running the ELIZA chatbot)
- Python and Jupyter Notebook (for running the tasks notebook)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### Running the ELIZA Chatbot

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/emerging-tech.git
   cd emerging-tech/eliza

2. **Open in Visual Studio Code:**
    ```sh
    code .

3. **Open eliza/index.html:**
    - In Visual Studio Code, open the eliza/index.html file located in the eliza folder.

4. **Run a live server:**
    - Install the Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code.
    - Right-click on eliza/index.html and select "Open with Live Server".

5. **Interact with the Chatbot:**
    - The ELIZA chatbot will open in your default web browser. You can start typing messages and interacting with the chatbot.


### Running the Trigrams Notebook

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/emerging-tech.git
    cd emerging-tech/tasks

2. **Open in Visual Studio Code:**
    ```sh
    code .

3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
    - In Visual Studio Code, open the tasks/trigrams.ipynb file located in the tasks folder.

4. **Run the Notebook:**
    - Ensure you have the Jupyter extension installed in Visual Studio Code.
    - Click on the "Run All" button to execute all cells in the notebook.

5. **View Results:**
    - The notebook will display the results of the various trigram analysis tasks.

### Running in Github Codespaces

1. **Open Repository in Codespaces:**
    - Navigate to the repository on GitHub.
    - Click on the "Code" button and select "Open with Codespaces".

2. **Follow The Steps Above:**
    - Follow the same steps as described for Visual Studio Code to run the ELIZA chatbot and the trigrams notebook.
